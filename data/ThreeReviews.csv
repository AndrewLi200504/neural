"Fantastic spot for an even or a quite cocktail.  They were swell to host the Yelp crew with a great drink menu and super attentive staff.I'd certainly recommend anything with the purred fruit in it (apple, any of them really)!

"Love, love, love the calamari. It's so good and spicy. There is an endless list of martinis and one is better than the next. There is a first and second floor, if you prefer more of a bar or lounge atmosphere. It's not a place I like for dinner, but for drinks and apps it's wonderful.

"Love this place. Stiff martinis and cocktails, cheap drinks, good service, nice atmosphere to chill in the upstairs lounge and hang up with your friends. Classy crowd and much more mature, older, and professional crowd. There aren't any of those college frat boys or belligerent drunks there, which is so great. Very nice place to wind down after a long day.
